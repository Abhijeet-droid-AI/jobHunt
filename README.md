The Job Hunt is a portal based full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
It allows job seekers to search and apply for job listings, and employers to post and manage job listings.
Some key features of the Job Portal app include:

-> User authentication: Users can create an account and log in to the app.
-> Job listing pages: Job seekers can browse job listings and search for jobs based on various criteria such as location, job title, and company.
-> Job application: Job seekers can create a profile and apply for jobs through the app.
-> Employer dashboard: Employers can post and manage job listings, and view job applications.
-> Admin panel: An administrative panel is included to manage the job portal, including approving/denying job listings and managing users.


This repository contains all of the code needed to run the Job Portal app, including the front-end React components, server-side code with Express,
and database interactions with MongoDB. You can use this code as a starting point for your own job portal app, and customize it to fit your specific requirements.
